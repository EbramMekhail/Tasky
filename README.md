Welcome to the Tasky MERN application!

This application is designed to help you keep track of your tasks and organize your workflow. It is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

Here are some features of Tasky:

* Create, and view tasks
* Organized tasks with time stamps from the creation date.
* Delete unwanted or completed Tasks.


To get started with the Tasky application, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You will also need to set up a MongoDB database and provide the connection details in an environment file. In addition in this env file, you must include a JWT secret, a link to your MongoDB, and set the production status to either development or production. Check the example env file.

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can clone the repository and install the project dependencies by running the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/EbramMekhail/Tasky.git`
`cd Tasky`
`npm install`

To start the development server, run the following command:

`npm run build`
`npm start`

This will start the server and the React development server. You can access the application at http://localhost:8000.
